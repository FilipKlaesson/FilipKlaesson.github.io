<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/FilipKlaesson/dbo/" target="_blank">dbo</a> is a compact
  python package for distributed bayesian optimization in multi-agent systems such as
  robotics source seeking problems. dbo utilizes sklearn GaussianProcessRegressor to model the surrogate function
  and offers multiple strategies to select queries. In addition to the vanilla
  bayesian optimization algorithm, dbo offers:
  <ul>
    <li>Distributed and parallel optimization</li>
    <li>Stochastic policy evaluations</li>
    <li>Expected acquisition policy over pending queries</li>
    <li>Internal acquisition function regularization</li>
    <li>Regret analysis outputs</li>
  </ul>
