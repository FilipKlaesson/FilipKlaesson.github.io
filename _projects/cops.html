  NASA's <a href="https://costar.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Team Costar</a> is taking part in
  <a href="https://www.subtchallenge.com/" target="_blank">DARPA Subterranean Challenge</a>
  which aims to develop tecniques to enable missions in subterranean environments.
  Such environments are typically large and suffer from severe communication constraints.
  We investigated multi-agent collaboration behaviors to efficiently explore frontiers while maintaining
  high situational awareness with a static base station. This research resulted in
  <a href="https://github.com/FilipKlaesson/cops" target="_blank">COPS</a>,
  a connectivity planner for communication-constrained networks.
  We posed a novel connectivity constraint that allow
  agents to execute objectives to a higher degree than previous work
  while still ensuring situational awareness over time. We also developed
  a clustering method that allow us to split the optimization problem
  into multiple smaller subproblems which increases the scalability drastically.
  The solution is throughly described in the paper
  <a href="http://FilipKlaesson.github.io/files/Intermittent_Connectivity_for_Exploration_in_Communication-Constrained_Multi-Agent_Systems" target="_blank">Intermittent Connectivity for Exploration in Communication-Constrained Multi-Agent Systems</a>.

  The video illustrates exploration of a network of 100 states using 10 agents. The color of a state indicates which cluster the state belongs to.
