<p>
  Chrgnet is a micro-service application that analyze and predicts behaviours of electric vehicle charinging stations.
  Chrgnet scrapes live data from charging stations and produce prediction models based on time-series analysis and artifical intelligence
  to analyze the pressure of stations based on spatio-temporal features. Chrgnet offers features such as:
  <ul>
    <li>Pressure prediction via time-series analysis and autoencoders</li>
    <li>Price optimization via integer linear programming optimization</li>
  </ul>
</p>
Chrgnet utilize a hexagonal hierarchical spatial index to partitioning the Earth's surface into hexagonal cells 
inorder to efficiently search in geo-spatial data. The figure below shows charging stations in the south of Sweden 
togheter their hexagonal grid cells.

<p>
  Using time-series analysis and autoencoders, the pressure level on charging stations is predicted. The pressure forecasting models 
  are used for prize optimization using integer linear programming optimization. The figure below demonstrates the pressure level 
  at charging stations in the south of Sweden. The color of each cell indicates the utilization of charging stations in the area.

  Chrgnet is build using a CI/CD pipeline including Jenkins, Helm and Kubernetes.
