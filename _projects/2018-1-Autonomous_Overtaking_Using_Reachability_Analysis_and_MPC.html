  In our B.S. thesis <i>Autonomous Overtaking Using Reachability Analysis and MPC</i> from
  <a href="https://www.kth.se/" target="_blank">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a>
  we study the problem of path planning under safetfy guarantees for autonomous vehicles.
  The reachable sets for the vehicles are represented by polyhedra.
  The boundary of the set differens is used as hard state constraints in the model predictive control (MPC) formulation, therefore guaranteeing safety.
  The figure below show the reachable sets for two vehicles.

  We predict a path using the MPC controller and track it using a PD-controller.
  The following figures shows the predicted trajectory and the executed trajectory.
