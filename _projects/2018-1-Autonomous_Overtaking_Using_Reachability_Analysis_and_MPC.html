  This research project was a part of the SURF research program at <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">California Institute of Technology</a>.
  In this work we focus on implementation of localization and control systems of an F1/10 unit in order to perform autonomous driving in multi-lane traffic.
  We use lidar data in order to map and localize in the environment using SLAM. For this purpose we used the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/" target="_blank">ROS</a> package <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/hector_slam" target="_blank">Hector Slam</a>.
  The map generated online is illustrated in the video below.

  The work is presented in the paper
  <a href="http://FilipKlaesson.github.io/files/Autonomous_Overtaking_Using_Reachability_Analysis_and_MPC.pdf" target="_blank">Design and implementation of a controller to advance in multi-lane traffic similar to human behavior using control improvisation</a>.
  The research was conducted at <a href="https://www.kth.se/" target="_blank">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a>.
