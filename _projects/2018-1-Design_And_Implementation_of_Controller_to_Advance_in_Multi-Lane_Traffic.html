  This research project was a part of the SURF research program at <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">California Institute of Technology</a>.
  In this work we focus on implementation of localization and control systems of an F1/10 unit in order to perform autonomous driving in multi-lane traffic.
  We use lidar data in order to map and localize in the environment using SLAM. For this purpose we used the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/" target="_blank">ROS</a> package <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/hector_slam" target="_blank">Hector Slam</a>.
  The map generated online is illustrated in the video below.

  For path planning and obstacle avoidance we use motion primitives to generate a trajectory.
  The generated trajectory is tracked using a PD-controller.
  The video below shows the F1/10 unit avoiding an obstacle in order to advance.
