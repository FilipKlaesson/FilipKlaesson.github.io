### Welcome!

<p>
  I am Filip and I am a software and systems engineer at <a href="https://www.saab.com/">Saab AB</a> system development and artificial intelligence in surveillance applications. I have a M.S. in <a href="https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/systems-control-robotics/description-1.8733">Systems, Control and Robotics</a>
  at <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a>, Stockholm Sweden.
  During the past years I was a visiting research student at <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> supervised by Professor
  <a href="https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/">Na Li</a> working on distributed bayesian optimization for multi-agent systems, and <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/">California Institute of Technology</a>, supervised by Prof.
  <a href="http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/wiki/Main_Page">Richard M. Murray</a>
  and Dr. <a href="https://pettni.github.io/#/">Petter Nilsson</a> working on optimization based multi-agent planning.
  I also conducted research at <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/">NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>, as a member of
  <a href="https://costar.jpl.nasa.gov/">Team Costar</a> in the
  <a href="https://www.subtchallenge.com/">Darpa Subterranean Challenge</a>.
