### Bio

<p>
  I am Filip and I am currently pursuing a M.Sc. in
  <a href="https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/systems-control-robotics/description-1.8733">Systems, Control and Robotics</a>
  at <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a>, Stockholm Sweden.
  During the past year I was a visiting research student at
  <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/">California Institute of Technology</a>, supervised by Professor
  <a href="http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/wiki/Main_Page">Richard M. Murray</a>
  and Ph.D. <a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~lnilsson/#/">Petter Nilsson</a>.
  I also conducted research at <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/">NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>, as a member of
  <a href="https://costar.jpl.nasa.gov/">Team Costar</a> in the
  <a href="https://www.subtchallenge.com/">Darpa Subterranean Challenge</a>.
  My research mainly focused on multi-agent coordination in communication constrained networks.
